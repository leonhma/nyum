* icecream (in different flavours)

> Scoop out small balls of icecream and put them in the egg carton lined with plastic wrap. Then put them in the freezer for 2-48 hours to harden.

---

* `160g` rice flour
* `60g` sugar
* `230ml` water

> Combine the flour and sugar in a microwave-safe bowl. Then mix in all the water. Once everything is homogenized, scraped down the sides of the bowl, cover it with plastic wrap and put it in the microwave for one minute. This replaces steaming rice and then turning it into paste.

> After microwaving, wet a spatula and fold the mixture together. Microwave again for one minute and repeat folding with a wet spatula. The dough should get stickier wit every microwaving.

> Put it in the microwave a last time for 30 seconds, then fold it together and dump the dough out on a parchment paper dusted with cornstarch.

---

> Dust the top of the dough and the rolling pin, too. Roll the dough out while dusting it with cornstarch if it gets too sticky. It should be about 6mm in thickness.

> Use circular cutters to cut out ...circles and wrap the hardened icecream balls in dough. Then wrap these in plastic wrap and put them back into the fridge.

>>> Take out the balls of icecream one at a time to prevent them from getting soft again.

---

> When serving, take them out of the freezer and give them 1-2 minutes to soften up.
